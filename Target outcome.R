#Target Outcome

#A total of 197 respondents answered this open question from a researchers’ perspective 
#(this includes answers from respondents who did not finish the survey). Two independent raters scored whether the answers could be assigned to
#one or more of five different categories. The raters agreed in 93% of the cases (Cohen’s kappa = .80). 
#A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20
#of them, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, like available time and money).
#Overall, 40 respondents (20%) stated that practical constraints determined their sample size.
#Furthermore, 45 respondents (23%) mentioned some rule of thumb (e.g., 20 subjects per condition), 41 (21%) based sample sizes on the common practice in their field of research,
#and 18 respondents (9%) wanted as many participants as possible, to have the highest
#possible power to detect an effect.
